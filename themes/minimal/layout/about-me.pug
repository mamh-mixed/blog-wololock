                                | I'm a pragmatic #[b problem solver].
                                | I have been working inside the Java and Groovy ecosystem since 2012, but I&nbsp;don't identify myself from a specific programming language, framework, or other technology perspectives.
                                | I&nbsp;prefer to choose #[b the right tool] to solve a particular problem instead.
                                | Sometimes you may find me coding in Java, Groovy, Bash, or even Haskell.
                                | Back in September 2014, I decided to make a career shift, and I became a full-time #[a(href=site.data.links.upwork) freelancer].
                                | It was one of the most important decisions I made career-wise.
                                | It opened new opportunities, like working (remotely) with startups around the globe or eventually joining Upwork.com in April 2017 to lead the continuous delivery transformation at the organization level.

                                | That is why I started #[a(href=site.data.links.torunjug) ToruÅ„ Java User Group] in February 2014 - a community that keeps connecting and growing up to this day.
                                | Aside from this blog, I also run a #[em.fa.fa-youtube] #[b YouTube] #[a(href=site.data.links.youtube) channel] where I publish video tutorials on a weekly basis.
                                | You can also find me on #[a(href=site.data.links.stackoverflow) Stack Overflow], where I regularly try to answer questions tagged with #[code groovy] or #[code jenkins-pipeline], to name just these two.

                            | Whenever I sit down to write a new blog post, I start with #[em "why?"] question, and then I try to explain, step-by-step, how to solve this specific problem.
                            | My goal is not only to give you the answer but also to make all I can to clarify:
