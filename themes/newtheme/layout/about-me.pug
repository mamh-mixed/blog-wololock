                            | I'm a pragmatic #[b problem solver].
                            | I spent last years around Java and Groovy ecosystem, but I don't identify myself from a specific programming language, framework, or other technology perspectives.
                            | I prefer to choose #[b the right tool] to solve a particular problem instead.
                            | I'm a #[a(href=site.data.links.upwork) freelancer] since 2014, and a #[b professional content creator] since June 1st, 2020 -&nbsp;I&nbsp;do write blog posts, create #[em.fa.fa-youtube] #[b YouTube] #[a(href=site.data.links.youtube) videos], and create other digital learning materials.
                            | I&nbsp;occasionally accept freelance gigs, but that's more an exception to the rule.

                            | That is why I started #[a(href=site.data.links.torunjug) ToruÅ„ Java User Group] in February 2014 - a community that keeps connecting and growing up to this day.
                            | I&nbsp;also got engaged in helping people on #[a(href=site.data.links.stackoverflow) Stack Overflow], where I regularly try to answer questions tagged with #[code groovy] or #[code jenkins-pipeline].

                            | Whenever I sit down to write a new blog post, I start with #[em "why?"] question, and then I try to explain, step-by-step, how to solve this specific problem.
                            | My goal is not only to give you the answer but also to make all I can to clarify:
