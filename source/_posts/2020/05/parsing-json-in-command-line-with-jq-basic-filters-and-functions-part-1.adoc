Have you ever wondered, what is the most convenient way to parse JSON data in the Unix/Linux command line?
For instance, how to parse some information from the `curl` JSON response?
Grep?
No, thank you.
There is a better tool for that.
And it's called `jq`.

Welcome to the first episode of the *jq cookbook* series!
The first episode is not about theory - we jump to the first exercise in just a second.
I strongly encourage you to {jq-download}[install `jq` command-line tool] in your operating system and follow me.
There are some exciting things to learn today, and we are starting right now!

toc::[]

== Introduction

In this blog post, I will use {openlibrary}[openlibrary.org public Search API].
The reason for that is simple - it returns quite complex and interesting data we can process, and it still mimics a real-life example.
I want to use this API to run a full-text search query.
I'm going to use my last name as a search term - it is not a very popular Polish last name, so there shouldn't be many results associated with it.

NOTE: The JSON response used in this example is 3631 lines long.
To keep all code samples clear, I will limit the JSON output to max. 10-15 lines.
The original document can be found here - icon:github[] {gist}[openlibrary.json].

.An example of openlibrary.org full-text search query
[source,bash]
----
$ curl -s "http://openlibrary.org/search.json?q=st%C4%99pniak"
{
 "start": 0,
 "num_found": 44,
 "numFound": 44,
 "docs": [
    ...
  ]
}
----

NOTE: My last name contains Polish letter `ę`, which gets encoded as `%C4%99`.

== Invoking `jq`

Once we have the JSON document to process, it's time to invoke `jq` processor.
The simplest way to do it is to pipe the output from the `curl` command to the `jq` input.

.Pipe from `curl` to `jq` example.
[source,bash]
----
$ curl -s "http://openlibrary.org/search.json?q=st%C4%99pniak" | jq .
----

NOTE: The `.` in the `jq` filter means *identity*.

This simple pipe doesn't do much, and `jq` just prints the JSON "as is."
However, there is one difference when compared with the plain `curl` response.
`jq` by default prints JSON document using "pretty" format, and it adds some basic colors.

== Processing input from command other than `curl`

Using pipes comes with huge benefits - it doesn't matter what command produces the input.
It means that we can forward the `curl` command output to a file, and then use this file to produce input for the `jq` processor.
This might be very useful when we do experiments, and we don't want to download the same JSON document over and over again.

.Forwarding `curl` output to the openlibrary.json file
[source,bash]
----
$ curl -s "http://openlibrary.org/search.json?q=st%C4%99pniak" > openlibrary.json
----

Once we captured the input, we can e.g., pipe commands `cat` and `jq` to produce the same result, but this time without involving the call over the network.

.Pipe from `cat` to `jq` example.
[source,bash]
----
$ cat openlibrary.json | jq .
----

However, using `cat` is not necessary if we want to read the input from a file - `jq` takes a file as an argument as well.
In the all upcoming examples, I will use this syntax to save a few characters.

.Taking input from the file example.
[source,bash]
----
$ jq . openlibrary.json
----

== Extracting fields from the array

Let's start processing the data with some real filters.
The document we took from the openlibrary.org Search API has a list under the `docs` key.
This list contains all documents matching the search term.
Every document is described using multiple fields, but we are interested in the `title`, `author_name`, and `publish_year` only.

The first filter we want to use is called *array/object value iterator `.[]`*.
This filter extracts values from the given array (or object), so the next filter in the pipeline gets applied to each element.
In our case, we want to apply `.docs[]` filter to extract documents.

.Applying array value iterator on the `docs` key.
[source,bash]
----
$ jq '.docs[]' openlibrary.json
{
  "title_suggest": "Słownik tajemnych gwar przestępczych",
  "edition_key": [
    "OL1174034M"
  ],
  "isbn": [
    "9781859170069",
    "1859170064"
  ],
  ....
----

The next step is to extract only specific fields.
`jq` filters support piping to apply new filters on top of the results from the previous ones.
It uses the same `|` symbol, but pay attention to one significant difference - piping filters happens inside the `jq` argument string.

.Piping `jq` filters to extract specific fields.
[source,bash]
----
$ jq '.docs[] | {title,author_name,publish_year}' openlibrary.json
{
  "title": "Słownik tajemnych gwar przestępczych",
  "author_name": [
    "Klemens Stępniak"
  ],
  "publish_year": [
    1993
  ]
}
{
  "title": "EU adjustment to eastern enlargement",
  "author_name": null,
  "publish_year": [
    1998
  ]
}
...
----

Looks good.
Every document got extracted to the new one, containing only three fields.
However, `author_name` and `publish_year` seem to be arrays.
We can update the filter to extract the first value from those arrays and store them as scalar values instead.

.Transforming arrays to scalar values example.
[source,bash]
----
$ jq '.docs[] | {title,author_name: .author_name[0], publish_year: .publish_year[0]}' openlibrary.json
{
  "title": "Słownik tajemnych gwar przestępczych",
  "author_name": "Klemens Stępniak",
  "publish_year": 1993
}
{
  "title": "EU adjustment to eastern enlargement",
  "author_name": null,
  "publish_year": 1998
}
...
----

I guess you already noticed that we can transform objects either by just referring to the field name (e.g. `title`) or by constructing the new field explicitly (e.g. `author_name: .author_name[0]`.)

== Filtering `null` values with `select(expr)` filter

When I looked at the response, I noticed that some documents were missing either `author_name` or `publish_year`.
We can exclude such documents from the final result using the `select(expr)` filter.

.Filtering objects containing `null` values.
[source,bash]
----
$ jq '.docs[] | {title,author_name: .author_name[0], publish_year: .publish_year[0]} | select(.author_name!=null and .publish_year!=null)' openlibrary.json
{
  "title": "Słownik tajemnych gwar przestępczych",
  "author_name": "Klemens Stępniak",
  "publish_year": 1993
}
{
  "title": "Integracja regionalna i transfer kapitału",
  "author_name": "Andrzej Stępniak",
  "publish_year": 1996
}
...
----

== Sorting by field with `sort_by(expr)` filter

Now let's say we want to get the result in a specific order.
What if we want to sort the final result by `publish_year`?
`jq` offer the `sort_by(expr)` filter, but before we apply it, we need to make one modification.
The `sort_by(expr)` filter works on arrays, and our current output is not an array.
If you look closely, you will see that this is just a set of JSON documents printed one after another.
We can transform it into a JSON array by wrapping our current long filter with square brackets - an array constructor.

Compare the following example with the previous one and spot the difference.

.Transforming set of JSON objects into a JSON array of objects using `[]` constructor.
[source,bash]
----
$ jq '[.docs[] | {title,author_name: .author_name[0], publish_year: .publish_year[0]} | select(.author_name!=null and .publish_year!=null)]' openlibrary.json
[
  {
    "title": "Słownik tajemnych gwar przestępczych",
    "author_name": "Klemens Stępniak",
    "publish_year": 1993
  },
  {
    "title": "Integracja regionalna i transfer kapitału",
    "author_name": "Andrzej Stępniak",
    "publish_year": 1996
  },
  ...
]
----

Once we have a JSON array constructed, we can pipe `sort_by(.publish_year)` into our filter.

.Sorting a JSON array of objects by specific field using `sort_by(expr)`.
[source,bash]
----
$ jq '[.docs[] | {title,author_name: .author_name[0], publish_year: .publish_year[0]} | select(.author_name!=null and .publish_year!=null)] | sort_by(.publish_year)' openlibrary.json
[
  {
    "title": "Rada Portu i Dróg Wodnych w Wolnym Mieście Gdańsku.  Gdańsku",
    "author_name": "Henryk Stępniak",
    "publish_year": 1971
  },
  {
    "title": "Potrącenie w systemie polskiego prawa cywilnego",
    "author_name": "Lechosław Stępniak",
    "publish_year": 1975
  },
  {
    "title": "Uzdatnianie złomu poprodukcyjnego",
    "author_name": "Stanisław Stępniak",
    "publish_year": 1978
  },
  ...
]
----

By default, `sort_by(expr)` sorts objects in the ascending order.
To sort objects in the descending order, we can pipe `reverse` filter after the `sort_by(expr)` one.

.Sorting in the descending order.
[source,bash]
----
$ jq '[.docs[] | {title,author_name: .author_name[0], publish_year: .publish_year[0]} | select(.author_name!=null and .publish_year!=null)] | sort_by(.publish_year) | reverse' openlibrary.json
[
  {
    "title": "Dziedzictwo archiwalne we współpracy Polski i Ukrainy",
    "author_name": "Władysław Stępniak",
    "publish_year": 2010
  },
  {
    "title": "Misja Służby Więziennej a jej zadania wobec aktualnej polityki karnej i oczekiwań społecznych",
    "author_name": "Polski Kongres Penitencjarny (4th 2008 Poznań, Poland)",
    "publish_year": 2008
  },
  {
    "title": "Czarny Bór",
    "author_name": "Władysław Stępniak",
    "publish_year": 2007
  },
  ...
]
----

== Limiting the size of the result with `limit(n;expr)` filter

As the next step, we may want to limit the size of the result.
Let's say we want to get the newest three publications as a result.
We can use `limit(n;expr)` filter, but we need to be aware of one thing.
To limit the size of an array using this filter, we need to use an expression that extracts values from an array for iteration - `.[]`.
Once `limit(n;expr)` limits the number of objects, it produces the output in the same format.
It means that we don't get an array but rather a set of separate results instead.

.Applying `limit(3;.[])` filter.
[source,bash]
----
$ jq '[.docs[] | {title,author_name: .author_name[0], publish_year: .publish_year[0]} | select(.author_name!=null and .publish_year!=null)] | sort_by(.publish_year)| reverse | limit(3;.[])' openlibrary.json
{
  "title": "Dziedzictwo archiwalne we współpracy Polski i Ukrainy",
  "author_name": "Władysław Stępniak",
  "publish_year": 2010
}
{
  "title": "Misja Służby Więziennej a jej zadania wobec aktualnej polityki karnej i oczekiwań społecznych",
  "author_name": "Polski Kongres Penitencjarny (4th 2008 Poznań, Poland)",
  "publish_year": 2008
}
{
  "title": "Czarny Bór",
  "author_name": "Władysław Stępniak",
  "publish_year": 2007
}
----

If we want to represent the result as a JSON array, we need to wrap `limit(n;expr)` filter with `[]` to construct an array again.

.Final JSON array of the three latest documents.
[source,bash]
----
$ jq '[.docs[] | {title,author_name: .author_name[0], publish_year: .publish_year[0]} | select(.author_name!=null and .publish_year!=null)] | sort_by(.publish_year)| reverse | [limit(3;.[])]' openlibrary.json
[
  {
    "title": "Dziedzictwo archiwalne we współpracy Polski i Ukrainy",
    "author_name": "Władysław Stępniak",
    "publish_year": 2010
  },
  {
    "title": "Misja Służby Więziennej a jej zadania wobec aktualnej polityki karnej i oczekiwań społecznych",
    "author_name": "Polski Kongres Penitencjarny (4th 2008 Poznań, Poland)",
    "publish_year": 2008
  },
  {
    "title": "Czarny Bór",
    "author_name": "Władysław Stępniak",
    "publish_year": 2007
  }
]
----

== Grouping by using `group_by(expr)` filter

Let's say we want to find out how many publications each author created.
`jq` offers built-in `group_by(expr)` filter we can use.
In our case, we will use `group_by(.author_name)` to group all publications by their authors.

.Grouping results using `group_by(.author_name)` filter.
[source,bash]
----
$ jq '[.docs[] | {title,author_name: .author_name[0], publish_year: .publish_year[0]} | select(.author_name!=null and .publish_year!=null)] | group_by(.author_name)' openlibrary.json
[
  [
    {
      "title": "Integracja regionalna i transfer kapitału",
      "author_name": "Andrzej Stępniak",
      "publish_year": 1996
    },
    {
      "title": "Promocja polskich podmiotów inwestycyjnych na obszarze Wspólnot Europejskich",
      "author_name": "Andrzej Stępniak",
      "publish_year": 1993
    },
    {
      "title": "Kwestia narodowa a społeczna na Śląsku Cieszyńskim pod koniec XIX i w początkach XX wieku, do 1920 roku",
      "author_name": "Andrzej Stępniak",
      "publish_year": 1986
    },
    {
      "title": "Polska-WE",
      "author_name": "Andrzej Stępniak",
      "publish_year": 1993
    }
  ],
  [
    {
      "title": "Kula jako symbol vanitas",
      "author_name": "Beata Purc-Stępniak",
      "publish_year": 2004
    }
  ],
  ....
]
----

As you can see now, `group_by(.author_name)` produced an array of arrays.
It's hard to say how many publications each author did from this document, so we might need to transform this output a bit.

The next filter we need to apply is `.[]` to start iterating over the grouped arrays.
We will pipe this iteration with a transformation that extracts `author_name` field from the first result using `{author_name: .[0].author_name}` filter.
And as we seen before, `.[] | {author_name: .[0].author_name}` combination produces a set of results, so we need to wrap it with `[]` to construct an array.

.Extracting `author_name` from the grouped result.
[source,bash]
----
$ jq '[.docs[] | {title,author_name: .author_name[0], publish_year: .publish_year[0]} | select(.author_name!=null and .publish_year!=null)] | group_by(.author_name)| [.[] | {author_name: .[0].author_name}]' openlibrary.json
[
  {
    "author_name": "Andrzej Stępniak"
  },
  {
    "author_name": "Beata Purc-Stępniak"
  },
  {
    "author_name": "Colloquia Jerzy Skowronek dedicata (10th 2004 Warsaw, Poland)"
  },
  ....
]
----

That's a good step forward - now we have author names extracted from the grouped result.
The next step is to update the transformation filter to also produce the `count` field - a field containing the number of publications.
There is a simple way to do it.
The current transformation filter, `[.[] | {author_name: .[0].author_name}]`, iterates the nested arrays that contain all documents associated with the same author.
It means that `.` (identity) in this filter refers to a list of objects, and that is why we extract the author name using `.[0].author_name` expression, which means: take the first object from the array and return its `author_name` value.
We can use this array to count its size.
In the `jq`, we have a filter called `length` that can be piped with an array to return its size.
So in our case, an expression `. | lenght` used in the context of this transformation will return the size of an array, which represents the number of publications.

.Extracting the number of publications using `length` filter.
[source,bash]
----
$ jq '[.docs[] | {title,author_name: .author_name[0], publish_year: .publish_year[0]} | select(.author_name!=null and .publish_year!=null)] | group_by(.author_name)| [.[] | {author_name: .[0].author_name, count: . | length}]' openlibrary.json
[
  {
    "author_name": "Andrzej Stępniak",
    "count": 4
  },
  {
    "author_name": "Beata Purc-Stępniak",
    "count": 1
  },
  {
    "author_name": "Colloquia Jerzy Skowronek dedicata (10th 2004 Warsaw, Poland)",
    "count": 1
  },
  ....
]
----

Voila! icon:smile-o[]

== Putting it all together

Let's finish this experiment by putting all commands we have learned today together.
We can add `sort_by(expr)` and `limit(n;expr)` to the latest query to produce the final result - an array of three authors that published the most documents.

.Extracting the number of publications using `length` filter.
[source,bash]
----
$ jq '[.docs[] | {title,author_name: .author_name[0], publish_year: .publish_year[0]} | select(.author_name!=null and .publish_year!=null)] | group_by(.author_name)| [.[] | {author_name: .[0].author_name, count: . | length}] | sort_by(.count) | reverse | [limit(3;.[])]' openlibrary.json
[
  {
    "author_name": "Władysław Stępniak",
    "count": 11
  },
  {
    "author_name": "Andrzej Stępniak",
    "count": 4
  },
  {
    "author_name": "Henryk Stępniak",
    "count": 3
  }
]
----

And that's it for today.
In the next episode, we will dive deeper into more advanced filters and functions that `jq` offers.
Stay tuned! icon:smile-o[]
