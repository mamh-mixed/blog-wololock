== My personal thoughts

I was close to guess the exact *TOP 3* - I thought it is going to be *Spock*, *Gradle*, and *Grails* (in this particular order.)
The *Groovy Console* result surprised me, and especially when it's compared to the `groovysh` - I definitely prefer to use a command-line tool instead of GUI-based one.

There is also a positive trend in the *Jenkins Pipeline* space - much more people use Groovy with pipelines instead of Job DSL plugin.

Also, {micronaut}[*Micronaut*] and {springboot}[*Spring Boot*] are head-to-head when it comes to the number of users, but it's hard to deduct anything from those numbers.

I was also surprised by the {codenarc}[*CodeNarc*], {geb}[*Geb*], and {picocli}[*Picocli*] small numbers.
The last two are used in the specific context, which may explain the number of votes.
However, {codenarc}[*CodeNarc*] is a static analysis tool for Groovy, and I would love to see more people using it to improve their code quality.

There are my first thoughts after looking at the survey results.
*And what are yours?*
Let me know in the comments bellow. üëç
