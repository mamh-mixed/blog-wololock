Are you looking for an easy and fast way to convert a JSON file to a CSV one?
In this blog post, I will show you how you can use `jq` command-line tool to do exactly that.

== Install `jq`

First, you need to install `jq` in your operating system - https://stedolan.github.io/jq/download/

== Prepare the JSON file

To convert JSON file to the CSV format we will need a JSON file that is represented by an array of objects.
In this tutorial, I use Github's Jobs API that returns JSON in that desired format.
Below you can find a `curl` command that searches for open kotlin job positions and stores the result in the `jobs.json` file.

[source,bash]
----
$ curl -s "https://jobs.github.com/positions.json?description=kotlin" > jobs.json

== Convert a JSON file to the CSV one

And here is how we can convert input JSON file to the CSV format.

[source,bash]
----
$ jq -r 'map({id,title,url,company,location}) | (first | keys_unsorted) as $keys | map([to_entries[] | .value]) as $rows | $keys,$rows[] | @csv' jobs.json > jobs.csv

$ cat jobs.csv
"id","title","url","company","location"

Let's deconstruct it piece by piece.

* We run `jq -r` to output raw strings (without double quotes.)
* In the filter part, we pipe multiple filters together, starting with `map({id,title,url,company,location})`. This filter instructs `jq` which keys we want to extract from the input JSON file.
* Then we use `(first | keys_unsorted) as $keys` filter which takes the first object, extracts its keys and stores them under the `$keys` variable as an array.
* Next, we use `map([to_entries[] | .value]) as $rows` filter which converts every key-value entry like `"foo": "bar"` into an object like `{"key":"foo","value":"bar"}` so we can extract only values as an array and store it in a `$rows` variable.
* Once we do it, we can use `$keys,$rows[]` filter to put keys and rows together and then pipe it with the `@csv` filter to convert JSON objects to CSV rows.
