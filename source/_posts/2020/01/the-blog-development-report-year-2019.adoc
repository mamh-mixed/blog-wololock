2019 was a fantastic year for my blog.
I didn't manage to write articles every month, but it didn't stop the growth.
Today I would like to share with you some numbers.
And the reason is simple - you've made those numbers possible, so I think you deserve to get some "behind the scenes" facts.

== 113,802 unique visitors

Let's start with the number of unique visitors.
In 2019, the blog was visited by *113,802* unique visitors.
The month with the lowest number of visitors was February - *2,581* unique visitors.
The month with the highest number of visitors was December - *17,443* unique visitors.

The blog has a very high bounce rate of *91,61%*, which means that only *8,39%* of visitors continue browsing the blog after opening the first page.
This number does not surprise me - a vast majority of people find the blog using a search engine, and they visit it to find a specific solution to their problem.
They find what they looked for, and they get back to their business.
However, I would like to lower the bounce rate in 2020 to something like 80-85%.

== Organic Search produced 91,8% traffic

There is no surprise here.
The Google search engine is responsible for *91,8%* traffic on the blog.
The second top channel is direct traffic with *4,5%* efficiency.
The third top channel is the Social Media traffic with just *1,6%* efficiency.

There is one interesting observation.
The most engaging traffic comes from referrals - the bounce rate, in this case, is *78,04%*.
The least engaging channel is, of course, Organic Search with *92,22%* bounce rate.

== The top search keyword - `groovy regex`

And here is a summary from the Search Console.
At the beginning of 2019, the blog was not ranked high in the Google index.
It started changing in the middle of the year, and I started seeing more and more traffic coming from Google.

== What's coming in 2020?

Don't expect any revolution.
I want to keep blogging about the things I'm genuinely interested in.
I want to blog more often, but the quality of the content is more important to me than the quantity.
There is one thing I can guarantee you - the blog remains ad-free.
I love the User Experience I've built here, and I don't want to change that.
There will be some alternative (and optional) ways to support my work, but ads are not in this category.

My goal for 2020 is to put more content on my small {youtube-url}[YouTube channel].
I recorded a few new videos already, so you should see a video posted every week.
_(Consider subscribing if you're not doing it already. icon:smile-o[])_

And that's it for today.
I wish you a fruitful year 2020!
Define your own rules and live according to them, and everything will go smoothly.
Take care, and see you in the next blog post!
