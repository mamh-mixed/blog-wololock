Every Java developer works with lists daily. There are many popular list (or collection) operations implemented in
the standard Java 8 library, but there is one that is useful and commonly used, yet missing - partitioning.
In this blog post, I would like to show you how you can split any list into chunks of fixed size without using
any 3rd party library. Let's start!

== Introduction

_Partitioning_ (also known as _chunking_) is an operation that transforms a collection of elements into a collection
of chunks of a given size. For instance, let's say we have a list of *7* elements (incrementing numbers from *1* to *7*)
and we want to split it into a list of chunks of size *2*.

[source,java]
----
[1,2,3,4,5,6,7] -> [[1,2], [3,4], [5,6], [7]]
----

Let's implement this operation using a new type of list, called `Partition`. We will extend the `AbstractList<List<T>>`
class, and we will implement two methods - `get(int index)` and `size()`. The whole idea here is to hide the original
list inside this class and modify its behavior, so instead of returning single elements from the original list,
we are going to return chunks of a given size. Let's take a look at the code and the following example to make
this concept much easier to understand.

.src/main/java/com/github/wololock/Partition.java
[source,java]
----
package com.github.wololock;

import java.util.AbstractList;
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.Arrays;
import java.util.Collection;
import java.util.List;
import java.util.concurrent.atomic.AtomicInteger;
import java.util.stream.Collectors;

public final class Partition<T> extends AbstractList<List<T>> {

    private final List<T> list;
    private final int chunkSize;

    public Partition(List<T> list, int chunkSize) {
        this.list = new ArrayList<>(list);
        this.chunkSize = chunkSize;
    }

    public static <T> Partition<T> ofSize(List<T> list, int chunkSize) {
        return new Partition<>(list, chunkSize);
    }

    @Override
    public List<T> get(int index) {
        int start = index * chunkSize;
        int end = Math.min(start + chunkSize, list.size());

        if (start > end) {
            throw new IndexOutOfBoundsException("Index " + index + " is out of the list range <0," + (size() - 1) + ">");
        }

        return new ArrayList<>(list.subList(start, end));
    }

    @Override
    public int size() {
        return (int) Math.ceil((double) list.size() / (double) chunkSize);
    }
}
----

All we have to do is to override those two methods, and our list of elements starts behaving like a list of chunks of
the input elements. Those overridden methods affect methods like `toString()`, `forEach()`, or `iterator()`.
Let's take a look at a simple usage example to see how this `Partition` object behaves:

.An example of Partition class usage
[source,java]
----
final List<Integer> numbers = Arrays.asList(1,2,3,4,5,6,7);

System.out.println(Partition.ofSize(numbers, 3));
System.out.println(Partition.ofSize(numbers, 2));
----

Running this example will produce the following input to the console:

.The console output
[source,text]
----
[[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7]]
[[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6], [7]]
----

== Why bother with creating a new class?

We can also ask ourselves if creating such a `Partition` class is mandatory. Maybe there is an alternative way to
achieve the same effect without using 3rd party libraries? Well, the good news is - there are at least two different
ways to get the same result. Let's take a look at the first of them.

=== Imperative for-loop

If we are OK with the imperative programming style, we can use Java's for-loop and do the partitioning while
iterating the input list. In this case, we need to control if the given number belongs to the existing chunk or
does it belong to the next one (by its index number). The code could look like this:

.Imperative for-loop method
[source,java]
----
final List<Integer> numbers = Arrays.asList(1,2,3,4,5,6,7);
final int chunkSize = 3;
final AtomicInteger counter = new AtomicInteger();

for (int number : numbers) {
    if (counter.getAndIncrement() % chunkSize == 0) {
        result.add(new ArrayList<>());
    }
    result.get(result.size() - 1).add(number);
}

System.out.println(result);
----

It  produces the following console output:

[source,text]
----
[[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7]]
----

=== Using Java 8 Stream API + grouping collector

Alternatively, we could use Java 8 Stream API and its `Collectors.groupingBy()` collector method. Using this
method we produce a map from a stream, but we can invoke `values()` method on the final map to get a collection
of all its values. Then we can decide if we want to stay with the `Collection<List<T>>` or if we want to cast
it to `List<List<T>>` by passing the collection to the, e.g. `ArrayList<T>`  constructor. Below you can find
an exemplary code.

[source,java]
----
final List<Integer> numbers = Arrays.asList(1,2,3,4,5,6,7);
final int chunkSize = 3;
final AtomicInteger counter = new AtomicInteger();

final Collection<List<Integer>> result = numbers.stream()
    .collect(Collectors.groupingBy(it -> counter.getAndIncrement() / chunkSize))
    .values();

System.out.println(result);
----

Less lines of code, but the same console output:

[source,text]
----
[[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7]]
----

== Which method to chose?

Now you may wonder - which method is the best? Should we use the `Partition` class, or is it better to use a good
old imperative style that is quite easy to read and reason about? It depends. There is one significant difference
between the first approach and the remaining two - the efficiency. Partitioning very small lists won't make a big
difference, but it starts making a huge (I mean huuuuge) difference when we start to play with large and larger
lists. Let's not speculate, but look at the numbers instead.

I created benchmark tests using https://openjdk.java.net/projects/code-tools/jmh/[JMH] for the following scenarios:

* partitioning *20* elements list into chunks of size *3*,
* partitioning *10,000* elements list into chunks of size *23*,
* and finally, partitioning *10,000,000* elements list into chunks of size *1024*.

We will measure the efficiency of 4 different methods:

* partitioning with the `Partition` class,
* partitioning with the imperative for-loop,
* partitioning with the Java 8 Stream API and `Collectors.groupingBy()`,
* partitioning with the Java 8 Stream API with a custom collector that makes use of `Partition` class.

All measurements use https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsecond[microsecond] unit of time. (*1 μs* is equal to *0.001 ms* and *0.000001 s*).

Let's look at those results more closely and see what do they look like as graphs.

The first benchmark tests a small list of *20* elements. As you can see, in this case, it doesn't make a big difference
which approach we choose. The difference between the fastest and the slowest approach is equal to *0.369 microseconds*.

However, things start to change when we have to deal with lists containing thousands of elements. The slowest method
requires *255 microseconds* to complete (*0.255 ms*), while the fastest method is almost *64 times* more efficient and it
needs only *4 microseconds* to do its job (*0.004 ms*). At this point, you can start thinking about the efficiency of
available solutions. The context still matters - if you perform partitioning operation rarely, you might not
need the fastest method to do the job efficiently.

The final benchmark has only a single winner - the `Partition` class method. In this case, the slowest method takes
almost *249341 microseconds* (*~250 ms*), while the fastest method does the same job in *8737 microseconds* (*8.737 ms*).
However, the gap between both methods decreased to the size of 28 times. It happens mostly because the `Partition`
class creates a copy of the input list. If we use a reference to the existing list instead of creating its copy,
we could reduce *8737 microseconds* to less than *2 microseconds*. It could be quite risky - using a reference instead
of a copy means that whenever the input list changes outside the context of `Partition` class, it changes
our partitioned list.

== What if I want to use a 3rd party library?

That's completely fine. There are at least two libraries that provide list partitioning operation,
using a similar method to the `Partition` class one.

* *Google Guava* has `Lists.partition(List list, int size)` method (https://google.github.io/guava/releases/22.0/api/docs/com/google/common/collect/Lists.html#partition-java.util.List-int-[docs])
* *Apache Commons Collections* has `ListUtils.partition(List list, int size)` method (https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-collections/apidocs/org/apache/commons/collections4/ListUtils.html#partition(java.util.List,%20int)[docs])

When you decide to use any of these two, be aware that they don't create a copy of the input list.
To avoid some nasty side effects, you may always want to pass a copy of a list instead.
