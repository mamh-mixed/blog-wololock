Groovy has many useful functions built-in, and one of them is `Iterable.combinations()` that takes aggregated collections and finds all combinations of items.
However, if we take a look its source code, we will find out that it was implemented using very imperative approach (nested for-loops + some if-statement).
In this blog post I will show you how to implement the same function using Groovy and +++{% post_link tail-recursive-methods-in-groovy tail-recursion algorithm %}+++. Enjoy!

== An example

Before we jump into a recursive algorithm implementation, let's take a look at some examples in Groovy Shell.

.Some examples of built-in `combinations()` function executed in groovysh
[source,bash]
----
groovy:000> [[]].combinations()
===> []
groovy:000> [['a']].combinations()
===> [[a]]
groovy:000> [['a',1],['b',2],[3,4,5]].combinations()
===> [[a, b, 3], [1, b, 3], [a, 2, 3], [1, 2, 3], [a, b, 4], [1, b, 4], [a, 2, 4], [1, 2, 4], [a, b, 5], [1, b, 5], [a, 2, 5], [1, 2, 5]]

== Tail-recursive algorithm

Without further ado, let's implement a recursive function that takes advantage of a tail call.
Our algorithm can be described in just a few steps:

1. If the input collection is empty, return accumulated result (stop condition).
2. Take the head of the input collection and create n new variants of each list collected in the accumulator by appending elements taken from the head list.
3. Call the function recursively with the tail of the input collection and re-evaluated accumulator.

We know the algorithm, let's write some code.

.Tail-recursive implementation of `combinations(list)` function
[source,groovy]
----
import groovy.transform.CompileStatic
import groovy.transform.TailRecursive

/**
 * Generates combinations of elements.
 *
 * Example:
 * combinations([['a',1], ['b',2], [10,20]]) == [['a','b',10],['a','b',20],['a',2,10],['a',2,20],[1,'b',10],[1,'b',20],[1,2,10],[1,2,20]]
 *
 */
@TailRecursive
@CompileStatic
<T> List<List<T>> combinations(final List<List<T>> xss, final List<List<T>> result = [[]]) {
    return !xss ? result : combinations(xss.tail(), process(xss.head(), result))
}

/**
 * Generates a new accumulator by creating `n` new variants for each
 * accumulated list by appending elements taken from head list (`xs`).
 *
 * Example:
 * acc = [[]], xs = [1,2,3] => [[1],[2],[3]]
 * acc = [[1],[2],[3]], xs = [4,5] => [[1,4],[1,5],[2,4],[2,5],[3,4],[3,5]]
 * acc = [[1,4],[1,5],[2,4],[2,5],[3,4],[3,5]], xs = ['a','b'] => [[1,4,'a'],[1,4,'b'],[1,5,'a'],[1,5,'b], ..., [3,5,'a'],[3,5,'b']]
 * ...
 */
@CompileStatic
<T> List<List<T>> process(final List<T> xs, final List<List<T>> acc) {
    return acc.inject([]) { yss, ys -> yss + xs.collect { x -> ys + x } }
}


// Let's see if implemented function meets expectations
def values = [[1,2,3],[4,5],[6,7,8,9]]
def expected = [[1,4,6],[1,4,7],[1,4,8],[1,4,9],[1,5,6],[1,5,7],[1,5,8],[1,5,9],[2,4,6],[2,4,7],[2,4,8],[2,4,9],[2,5,6],[2,5,7],[2,5,8],[2,5,9],[3,4,6],[3,4,7],[3,4,8],[3,4,9],[3,5,6],[3,5,7],[3,5,8],[3,5,9]]
assert combinations(values) == expected

// Let's see if combinations(list) produces the same output as list.combinations()
def list = [['a',1], ['b',2], [10,20]]
assert (list.combinations()) as Set == (combinations(list) as Set)
----

I made this exemplary code quite verbose, but you can see that after removing the verbosity it could be a one-liner.

== Bonus: Haskell implementation

The recursive algorithm we have implemented using Groovy asks for an example in a functional language. Let's see what could the implementation of combinations function look like in Haskell.

.Haskell implementation of combinations function
[source,haskell]
----
combinations :: [[a]] -> [[a]]
combinations []       = [[]]
combinations (xs:xss) = [x : xs' | x <- xs, xs' <- combinations xss]
----

It's even more concise and more straightforward - just as expected.

.Exemplary usage of combinations function in ghci
[source,bash]
----
*Prelude> combinations [[1,2],[3,4],[5,6]]
[[1,3,5],[1,3,6],[1,4,5],[1,4,6],[2,3,5],[2,3,6],[2,4,5],[2,4,6]]
*Prelude> combinations [['a','b'], ['c'], ['d','e','f']]
["acd","ace","acf","bcd","bce","bcf"]
*Prelude> combinations []
[[]]
