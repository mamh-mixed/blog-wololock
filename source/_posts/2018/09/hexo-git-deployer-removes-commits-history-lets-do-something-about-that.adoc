I have found https://hexo.io[Hexo] a great tool for building a blog and apply many well-known software development
principles. One of them is automation. This is why I have decided to integrate this blog with https://travis-ci.org/wololock/wololock.github.io[Travis CI]
to perform a deployment to GitHub pages. It was a great decision, however a few days later I have noticed one significant
issue - deploying a new version of the blog from the CI server caused removing all commits from `master` branch
and starting with initial commit over and over again. It&nbsp;took me a while to find working solution to this problem.
This blog post explains a simple solution to this problem.

== Why does `hexo deploy` removes the history in the first place?

Let's start with understanding what actually happens. When you run `hexo deploy` footnote:[Documentation: https://hexo.io/docs/deployment]
command for a&nbsp;git deployment option, Hexo creates a hidden folder called `.deploy_git` and it copies generated files from the
`public` folder to it. Next, it initializes git repository (if it does not yet exist) that targets Hexo's remote deploy branch and
it executes `git push --force` from this folder to a repository and a&nbsp;branch you have defined in the `_config.yml` footnote:[https://github.com/wololock/wololock.github.io/blob/develop/_config.yml#L88-L93] file.

.Deployment configuration of e.printstacktrace.blog
[source,yaml]
----
deploy:
  type: git
  repo: git@github.com:wololock/wololock.github.io.git
  branch: master
----

If you build and deploy your blog from your local computer and you never delete (or accidentally lost) your blog
source code, you may never face this issue. When you do it from the workspace that does not get wiped, then
the folder `.deploy_git` with it's full history exists and `hexo deploy` pushes only those files that
were actually modified. When you move to CI server like Travis CI, this is not true anymore, because it executes build
with the clean workspace and the fresh clone of the repository. In&nbsp;this case `.deploy_git` folder simply does not exist
and gets recreated from scratch.

== How to deploy and keep the history then?

The solution I have found working for me well is fairly simple. Previously my `.travis.yml` file part responsible
for the deployment looked something like this:

.Previous Travis CI deployment configuration
[source,yaml]
----
deploy:
  skip_cleanup: true
  provider: script
  script: hexo deploy
  on:
    branch: develop
----

It simply triggered `hexo deploy` whenever I pushed changes to `develop` branch. In this case it ended up
creating a new `.deploy_git` folder and force pushing an initial commit to the GitHub repository. Then, I have
made a small improvement - I've created a short bash script instead.

.Deploy script used by e.printstacktrace.blog
[source,bash]
----
include::deploy.sh[]
----

This script does exactly what it says in the comments:

* It clones `master` branch from remote repository to `.deploy_git` to get existing commits history.
* Then it removes all non-git objects repository files from `.deploy_git` so copying files back from `public` folder
will track deleted files.
* And finally - it executes `hexo deploy` command that does the regular deployment.

And the last but not least, here is what deployment configuration part looks like after introducing
deployment bash script:

.Current Travis CI deployment configuration
[source,yaml]
----
deploy:
  skip_cleanup: true
  provider: script
  script: sh deploy.sh
  on:
    branch: develop
----

Thanks to this solution I was able to keep the history of site updates and to track changes of files
that were actually modified with the given site update.

== Final words

I hope you find this post useful. It describes solution for Hexo + Travis CI + GitHub use case, but
it can solve problems that other similar static site generators may have when running from CI server
environment.
