Welcome to the part 3 of _"Non-blocking and async http://micronaut.io[Micronaut]"_ article. In the +++{% post_link micronaut-non-blocking-and-async-part-2 previous post %}+++
we have created connection between two services using HTTP protocol and we have run some experiments with handling
10,000 requests. Today we are going to extend this example by setting some timeouts to see what happens.

NOTE: Source code of the application described in this blog post can be found here https://github.com/wololock/micronaut-nonblocking-async-demo

== The motivation

Returning 4 recommendations from our mock recommendations-service takes approximately 1250&nbsp;milliseconds. This is
actually a huge amount of time. Let's assume that we can't do anything to decrease latency on requests to product-service,
yet we have to return any result in less than 300&nbsp;milliseconds to make any usage of recommendations-service.

== The solution

In the previous post we didn't introduce any timeouts in the part responsible for communication between services.
Let's fix it now by adding 250 milliseconds timeout to the client call:

[source,java]
----
package com.github.wololock.micronaut.recommendation;

import io.micronaut.http.annotation.Controller;
import io.micronaut.http.annotation.Get;
import io.reactivex.Maybe;
import io.reactivex.Observable;
import io.reactivex.Single;
import com.github.wololock.micronaut.products.Product;
import com.github.wololock.micronaut.products.ProductClient;
import org.slf4j.Logger;
import org.slf4j.LoggerFactory;

import java.util.Arrays;
import java.util.List;
import java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit;

@Controller("/recommendations")
final class RecommendationController {

    private static final Logger log = LoggerFactory.getLogger(RecommendationController.class);

    private static final List<String> ids = Arrays.asList("PROD-001", "PROD-002", "PROD-003", "PROD-004");

    private final ProductClient productClient;

    public RecommendationController(ProductClient productClient) {
        this.productClient = productClient;
    }

    @Get
    public Single<List<Product>> getRecommendations() {
        log.debug("RecommendationController.getRecommendations() called...");

        return Observable.fromIterable(ids)
                .flatMap(id -> productClient.getProduct(id)
                        .timeout(250, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS, Maybe.empty()) //<1>
                        .toObservable()
                )
                .toList();
    }
}
----
<1> 250 milliseconds timeout that returns `Maybe.empty()` when occurs.

We use `Maybe.timeout(timeout, unit, fallback)` footnote:[http://reactivex.io/RxJava/javadoc/io/reactivex/Maybe.html#timeout-long-java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit-io.reactivex.MaybeSource-]
to specify a timeout policy - if client does not return a response in 250 milliseconds we simply drop the connection
and return a fallback object. Here is what the request to `localhost:8080/recommendations` returns now:

[source,http]
----
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Date: Tue, 30 Oct 2018 11:18:33 GMT
connection: keep-alive
content-length: 119
content-type: application/json

[
    {
        "id": "PROD-001",
        "name": "Micronaut in Action",
        "price": 29.99
    },
    {
        "id": "PROD-002",
        "name": "Netty in Action",
        "price": 31.22
    }
]
----

We get only two products in return and this is expected, because only these two have a latency that is smaller than
250 milliseconds.

Let's execute 10 concurrent requests using https://github.com/JoeDog/siege[siege]:

[source,bash]
----
siege -c 10 -r 1 http://localhost:8080/recommendations

== Are we done?

We might think that everything is fine and we are ready to deploy to production. Before that let's run
https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/programs/ab.html[Apache HTTP Bench] just to make sure we are ready to go:

[source,bash]
----
ab -c 500 -n 2000 http://localhost:8080/recommendations
----

500 concurrent requests, 2,000 in total. The result:

Apache Bench revealed that we have a huge problem with handling 500 concurrent requests - median 1290 milliseconds when
we drop connection after 250 ms timeout is not something we would expect here. It also shows that 1570 from 2000 requests
were marked as failed based on the content length - it means that some requests returned a response with two products, some
with just a single product, and there were most probably some requests with empty result.

Let's run one more experiment, but this time with 200 concurrent requests and let's take a look at the result `ab` produced:

A smaller concurrent connections number produced much better result - median 262 ms and only 280 failed requests (based
on the content length). Why such a huge difference? Well, we need to be aware of one important thing. Even if we drop
client connection after 250 ms timeout, the server is still processing all requests executed to product-service. It means
that when server receives 500 concurrent requests to `localhost:8080/recommendations` it processes 1,000 requests that
are never returned back to the client. It total it gives us 4,000 orphan requests, which allocate resources, consume them
and return back to the even-loop, but never get back to the caller.

== Any solution?

There is no simple solution to this kind of problems. It shows the importance of a proper application monitoring. If we
only monitor client requests success rate we would notice, that PROD-003 and PROD-004 products never return to the client.
Maybe it is a good reason to drop recommending these products? Let's see what happens if we recommend only first two products?

It's still far from the best results, however 200 concurrent requests produce almost ideal results. With 500 we still see
that application has some difficulties and hits timeouts for PROD-002 in some cases. But this is not a bulletproof benchmark
and we are only experimenting to see the order of magnitude.

== Conclusion

And that's it, we finally reached the end of 3 part article on quick start to non-blocking and async processing in Micronaut.
I hope you have enjoyed it and you've learned something useful during this journey. If you are looking for more - let's
stay in touch. More Micronaut articles are coming soon!
