{micronaut-url}[Micronaut] framework inventors says it is designed for building modern microservice applications.
It supports reactive and non-blocking HTTP requests processing thanks to a powerful network application framework - {netty-url}[Netty].
In this blog post I will give you a quick and practical introduction to a asynchronous HTTP requests processing using a simple demo application.
No more talking, it's time to make our hands dirty with some Micronaut application code! icon:smile-o[]

WARNING: This is not a introduction to Micronaut. If you are not familiar with the framework, consider reading official
{micronaut-docs}[User Guide] first.

== Introduction

In this article, we are going to build a demo application that mimics communication between two remote services, that for simplicity are part of the same application:

* *product-service* exposes a single endpoint `(GET) /product/{id}` which returns specific product information. We will
simulate high latency (fixed on different products) - the idea is that this service might communicate with `n` different
remote services to collect final product information.
* *recommendations-service* exposes a single endpoint `(GET) /recommendations` which returns fixed number of recommendations.
We won't focus on building solid recommendations system - this service is just a mock that communicates over HTTP with
*product-service* to get the information about products it's going to recommend to the user. A single HTTP request to
recommendations-service endpoint will cause 4 additional non-blocking requests to product-service endpoint.

NOTE: This example was inspired by demo I made for my https://github.com/wololock/ratpack-quickstart-demo[_"Ratpack - practical quickstart"_] presentation.



Micronaut is shipped with a handy command line tool `mn`:

NOTE: You can install Micronaut CLI using https://sdkman.io/sdks#micronaut[SDKMAN!] - `sdk install micronaut`

Now we are able to create Micronaut application skeleton:

[source,text,subs="quotes"]
----
$ mn create-app micronaut-nonblocking-async-demo --lang=java --features=spock
[.color-purple]#|# Generating Java project...
[.color-purple]#|# Application created at /tmp/micronaut-nonblocking-async-demo
----

It creates a new application using Gradle build tool (switching to Maven is possible if needed).
We want to use Java (`--lang=java`) and Spock testing framework (`--features=spock`) instead of JUnit.
After applying a few  small changes our final `build.gradle` file looks like this:

.build.gradle

== Implementing product-service

We start with writing some product-service code. For simplicity we will put both services to a single app - this is OK
for this demo, but in real-life you would keep these two services as separate applications. Here is a list of files
we are going to create:

[source,bash]
----
products
├── ProductClient.java
├── ProductController.java
├── Product.java
└── ProductService.java
----

* `Product` class is defined by 3 simple properties: `id`, `name` and `price`. https://github.com/wololock/micronaut-nonblocking-async-demo/blob/master/src/main/java/com/github/wololock/micronaut/products/Product.java[Nothing fancy].
* `ProductService` stores 4 exemplary products in memory and simulates high latency when retrieving products by id.
* `ProductController` exposes a public API endpoint.
* `ProductClient` is Micronaut's special interface that generates an HTTP client we can use to communicate with the API
from other services (from recommendations-service for instance).

Here is what implementation of `ProductService` looks like:

.src/main/java/com/github/wololock/micronaut/products/ProductService.java
[source,java]
----
package com.github.wololock.micronaut.products;

import io.reactivex.Maybe;
import io.reactivex.schedulers.Schedulers;
import org.slf4j.Logger;
import org.slf4j.LoggerFactory;

import javax.inject.Singleton;
import java.math.BigDecimal;
import java.util.Map;
import java.util.concurrent.ConcurrentHashMap;
import java.util.function.Supplier;

@Singleton //<1>
final class ProductService {

    private static final Logger log = LoggerFactory.getLogger(ProductService.class);

    private static final Map<String, Supplier<Product>> products = new ConcurrentHashMap<>();

    static {
        products.put("PROD-001", createProduct("PROD-001", "Micronaut in Action", 29.99, 120));
        products.put("PROD-002", createProduct("PROD-002", "Netty in Action", 31.22, 190));
        products.put("PROD-003", createProduct("PROD-003", "Effective Java, 3rd edition", 31.22, 600));
        products.put("PROD-004", createProduct("PROD-004", "Clean Code", 31.22, 1200));
    }

    public Maybe<Product> findProductById(final String id) { //<2>
        return Maybe.just(id)
                .subscribeOn(Schedulers.io()) //<3>
                .map(it -> products.getOrDefault(it, () -> null).get());
    }

    private static Supplier<Product> createProduct(final String id, final String name, final Double price, final int latency) {
        return () -> {
            simulateLatency(latency); //<4>
            log.debug("Product with id {} ready to return...", id);
            return new Product(id, name, BigDecimal.valueOf(price));
        };
    }

    private static void simulateLatency(final int millis) {
        try {
            Thread.sleep(millis);
        } catch (InterruptedException ignored) {}
    }
}
----
<1> `@javax.inject.Singleton` annotation instructs Micronaut that this class represents a bean to inject.
<2> `Maybe<Product>` return type means that this method returns a single `Product`, or no value, or throws exception.
<3> Calling `subscribeOn(Schedulers.io())` moves calculation to a scheduler responsible for running IO-bound work.
<4> We simulate latency with `Thread.sleep(millis)` before returning a `Product` object from a supplier.

The most important and the most interesting part is implemented in `ProductService` class. Firstly, we store a few products
in memory as `Supplier<Product>` to simulate latency inside supplier's body. Secondly, we return `Maybe<Product>` type
to inform that `Product` may or not be returned, which is expected if we call the method with `id` that does not map to
any existing product.

Take a look how the `findProductById` method is implemented. We start with creating `Maybe<String>` object using `id`
received from the method call. Then we switch to `Schedulers.io()` scheduler to move execution of this blocking
operation to a thread-pool that is designed to execute such operations. And finally we map `id` to a product associated
with it and we return `Maybe<Product>` type. For this demo purpose we also log some debug information - it will be useful
when we execute a few parallel requests to see how it works.

Now it is time to implement `ProductController` - our public API endpoint:

.src/main/java/com/github/wololock/micronaut/products/ProductController.java
[source,java]
----
package com.github.wololock.micronaut.products;

import io.micronaut.http.annotation.Controller;
import io.micronaut.http.annotation.Get;
import io.reactivex.Maybe;
import org.slf4j.Logger;
import org.slf4j.LoggerFactory;

@Controller("/product") //<1>
final class ProductController {

    private static final Logger log = LoggerFactory.getLogger(ProductController.class);

    private final ProductService productService;

    public ProductController(ProductService productService) { //<2>
        this.productService = productService;
    }

    @Get("/{id}") //<3>
    public Maybe<Product> getProduct(String id) { //<4>
        log.debug("ProductController.getProduct({}) executed...", id);

        return productService.findProductById(id).onErrorComplete(); //<5>
    }
}
----
<1> `@Controller("/products")` annotation registers HTTP handler class.
<2> Constructor injection does not require any annotation.
<3> `@Get("/{id}")` defines GET mapping and path token `id`.
<4> `Maybe<Product>` return type instructs event-loop that we are going to execute this request in a non-blocking manner.
<5> Calling `onErrorComplete()` ensures that in case of `null` product HTTP server will produce `404 Not Found` response.

And the last, but not least - `ProductClient` interface:

.src/main/java/com/github/wololock/micronaut/products/ProductClient.java
[source,java]
----
package com.github.wololock.micronaut.products;

import io.micronaut.http.annotation.Get;
import io.micronaut.http.client.annotation.Client;
import io.reactivex.Maybe;

@Client("/product")
public interface ProductClient {

    @Get("/{id}")
    Maybe<Product> getProduct(final String id);
}
----

Micronaut will generate and compile HTTP client that implements this interface - no runtime proxy that slows down our applications. Brilliant!

NOTE: Source code of the application described in this blog post can be found here https://github.com/wololock/micronaut-nonblocking-async-demo

== Running product-service

Now it is time to run our service and see it in action:

[source,bash]
----
$ gradle run
----

After about a second we will information that our server application is running:

[source,bash]
----
01:31:27.475 [main] INFO  - Startup completed in 636ms. Server Running: http://localhost:8080
----

Let's execute two requests. I will use https://httpie.org/[HTTPie] in below examples:

[source,http,subs="quotes"]
----
*$ http localhost:8080/product/PROD-001*

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Date: Thu, 25 Oct 2018 01:34:15 GMT
connection: keep-alive
content-length: 60
content-type: application/json

{
    "id": "PROD-001",
    "name": "Micronaut in Action",
    "price": 29.99
}
----

Product with id `PROD-001` returned successfully. Now let's take a look what does the response for non-existing product looks like:

[source,http,subs="quotes"]
----
*$ http localhost:8080/product/PROD-008*

HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found
Date: Thu, 25 Oct 2018 01:35:11 GMT
connection: close
content-length: 93
content-type: application/json

{
    "_links": {
        "self": {
            "href": "/product/PROD-008",
            "templated": false
        }
    },
    "message": "Page Not Found"
}
----

== Executing multiple parallel requests

Above examples shown that application works as expected. But does it process requests in a&nbsp;non-blocking manner?
Let's test it out. Firstly, we will update `application.yml` and set a single event-loop to process all incoming requests:

.src/main/resources/application.yml
[source,yml]
----
micronaut:
    application:
        name: micronaut-nonblocking-async-demo

    server:
        maxRequestSize: 1MB
        host: localhost
        netty:
           maxHeaderSize: 500KB
           worker:
              threads: 1
           parent:
              threads: 1
           childOptions:
              autoRead: true
----

Following configuration means that there is only one event-loop (a single thread) that is responsible for handling incoming
HTTP requests. The whole idea here is to keep this event-loop ready to process requests and delegate all blocking operations
to a separate thread-pool where they can block for some amount of time.

We will use https://github.com/JoeDog/siege[siege] - an http load tester and benchmarking command line tool that allows
us executing multiple concurrent requests. We will execute 20 multiple HTTP requests to see how our application reacts
to 20 concurrent requests with just a single thread dedicated to handling requests:

[source,bash]
----
$ siege -c 20 -r 1 http://localhost:8080/product/PROD-003

Our application handled 20 concurrent requests with a single computation thread. `PROD-003` has `600ms` latency, so all
responses returned approximately at the same time. And here is what console log looks like after handling these 20 requests:

[source,bash]

----

This log shows clearly what is the biggest benefit of non-blocking HTTP requests processing. We use a single event-loop
running in `nioEventLoopGroup-1-2` thread. It receives HTTP request and instead of blocking for 600 milliseconds (latency of
`PROD-003` product) it delegates operation to IO thread pool and is ready to handle next request. The default IO thread
pool uses cached thread pool, so in this case it spawns 20 threads to handle the operation and they will wait 60 seconds
to handle another job.

== Conclusion

Part 1 ends here. You have seen Micronaut's non-blocking processing in action, and what is even more important - now you
know that switching from blocking model to a non-blocking one does not require a huge mind shift. In the part 2 we will
