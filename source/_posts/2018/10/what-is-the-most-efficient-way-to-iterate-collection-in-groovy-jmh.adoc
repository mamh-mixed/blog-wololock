I guess you may heard about Groovy's `Collection.each(Closure cl)` method - it was introduced 15 years ago footnote:[The first commit in the repository tree that mentions `DefaultGroovyMethods.each(Object self, Closure cl)`
method comes from https://github.com/apache/groovy/commit/408b29851d7bbe4d343340832297e4be7e0c5578#diff-d88e358e812ea2b6f64924cfa2b616fdR91[September 11th 2003]]
and it was a great alternative for a good old for-loop, for-each or even using an iterator approach. You may
also heard, that you should not overuse it, because creating a closure to do such simple operation like
collection iteration is an overhead. But what if I tell you that nothing could be further from the truth -
Groovy's `each` method may be faster than iterator or Java's for-each. Sounds interesting? Enjoy the reading!

== Preparation

Before we dig deeper, let's define the initial conditions. We are going to measure an execution time of a few
different iteration variants. Each variant will do the same simple operation - it will accumulate the sum
of numbers from 0 to 10 millions. We will do it using `AtomicLong` object and in the most imperative way possible - it
is not about finding the most efficient sum operation - it is about giving all variants a simple job to do, so we can
focus on iteration process and draw a conclusion after all.

[NOTE]
We are going to use http://openjdk.java.net/projects/code-tools/jmh/[JMH] benchmark tool and its https://github.com/melix/jmh-gradle-plugin[Gradle plugin].

What methods are we going to test? We will compare:

* Groovy's `each` method
* Java's for-loop approach
* Java's for-each approach
* Java's iterator approach
* Java 8 `forEach` method using closure
* Java 8 `forEach` method using anonymous class

[WARNING]
This test uses Groovy 2.4 which does not support Java 8 lambda expressions - that is why we will use
Java 8 `forEach` method with an anonymous class instead.

== The code

Let's start with `build.gradle` file

.build.gradle
[source,groovy]
----
buildscript {
  repositories {
    jcenter()
    maven {
      url "https://plugins.gradle.org/m2/"
    }
  }
  dependencies {
    classpath "me.champeau.gradle:jmh-gradle-plugin:0.4.7"
  }
}

apply plugin: "idea"
apply plugin: "groovy"
apply plugin: "me.champeau.gradle.jmh"

repositories {
    jcenter()
}

dependencies {
    compile 'org.codehaus.groovy:groovy-all:2.4.12'
}

jmh {
    include = ['bench\\.*'] //<1>
    benchmarkMode = ['avgt'] //<2>
    timeUnit = 'ms' //<3>
    iterations = 120 //<4>
    timeOnIteration = '1s' //<5>
    warmup = '60s' //<6>
    warmupIterations = 1 //<7>
    batchSize = 1
    fork = 1
}

<3> Measure time in milliseconds
<4> Execute 120 iterations
<5> Each iteration is limited to 1 second
<6> Warm-up for 60 seconds
<7> Use a single iteration to warm-up

And now let's take a look at our benchmark test class:

.src/jmh/groovy/bench/GroovyIterationBenchmarks.groovy
[source,groovy]
----
package bench

import org.openjdk.jmh.annotations.Benchmark

        }
        return result
    }

    @Benchmark
    AtomicLong iteratorTest() { //<5>
        final AtomicLong result = new AtomicLong()
        final Iterator<Integer> iterator = numbers.iterator()
        while (iterator.hasNext()) {
            result.addAndGet(iterator.next())
        }
        return result
    }

    @Benchmark

        final AtomicLong result = new AtomicLong()
        numbers.forEach { result.addAndGet((int) it) }
        return result
    }

                result.addAndGet(number)
            }
        })
        return result
    }

== The results

We are ready to execute the test using Gradle:

[source,bash]
----
./gradlew jmh
----

And after about 7 minutes we can take a look at the results:

.Benchmark results for 10M collection size
[source,text]
----
Benchmark                                       Mode  Cnt    Score   Error  Units
GroovyBench.eachTest                            avgt  120  652,584 ± 2,064  ms/op
GroovyBench.forEachTest                         avgt  120  221,790 ± 1,675  ms/op
GroovyBench.forLoopTest                         avgt  120  533,534 ± 2,521  ms/op
GroovyBench.iteratorTest                        avgt  120  369,492 ± 0,930  ms/op
GroovyBench.java8ForEachWithAnonymousClassTest  avgt  120  248,371 ± 2,803  ms/op
GroovyBench.java8ForEachWithClosureTest         avgt  120  785,309 ± 3,096  ms/op
----

* The benchmarks shows clearly that using Groovy `each` with a closure is almost three times slower
than good old Java for-each loop (`653` ms versus `222` ms).
* Java for-each and Java 8 `forEach` with anonymous class are pretty close - `222` ms versus `248` ms.
* The slowest variant was Java 8 `forEach` with a closure in place of a lambda expression - it took
`785` ms to execute (`133` ms more than Groovy `each`).

No matter which variant won in this run it still feels like there is something wrong - iterating collection
of 10 millions integers took `304` milliseconds at best, which is still quite slow. The reason of that is
because we were testing Groovy's dynamic method invocation which comes with some overhead. Let's turn on
static compilation and see how it works.

[NOTE]
Laptop specs: JDK 1.8.0_162 (Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM, 25.162-b12), Groovy 2.4.12, Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-4900MQ CPU @ 2.80GHz (4 cores, cache size 8192 KB), 16 GB RAM, OS: Fedora 26 (64 bit)

== The improvement: static compilation

Without further ado, let's add `@CompileStatic` and `@TypeChekced` annotations to our `GroovyBench` class:

.Enabling static compilation and type checks
[source,groovy]
----
package bench

import groovy.transform.CompileStatic
import groovy.transform.TypeChecked
import org.openjdk.jmh.annotations.Benchmark
import org.openjdk.jmh.annotations.Scope
import org.openjdk.jmh.annotations.State

import java.util.concurrent.atomic.AtomicLong
import java.util.function.Consumer

@State(Scope.Benchmark)
@CompileStatic //<1>
@TypeChecked //<2>
class GroovyBench {

    final List<Integer> numbers = 0..10_000_000

    // the same benchmark methods

}
----

Let's run `./gradlew clean jmh` and see the results:

.Benchmark results for statically compiled Groovy code
[source,text]
----
Benchmark                                       Mode  Cnt    Score   Error  Units
GroovyBench.eachTest                            avgt  120   91,897 ± 0,346  ms/op
GroovyBench.forEachTest                         avgt  120   96,422 ± 0,550  ms/op
GroovyBench.forLoopTest                         avgt  120  139,119 ± 0,723  ms/op
GroovyBench.iteratorTest                        avgt  120  103,568 ± 0,648  ms/op
GroovyBench.java8ForEachWithAnonymousClassTest  avgt  120  102,460 ± 2,473  ms/op
GroovyBench.java8ForEachWithClosureTest         avgt  120  400,481 ± 1,036  ms/op
----

As you can see, enabling static compilation was a game changer! To sum it up:

* Groovy `each` recorded the best result - `91.897` ms (previously: `652.584` ms)
* The second best result belongs to Java for-each - `96.422` ms (previously: `221.790` ms)
* Java 8 `forEach` and iterator recorded almost the same result - `102.460` ms and `103.568` ms accordingly.
* And again the slowest result belongs to Java 8 `forEach` with a closure - `400.481` ms (previously: `785.309 ` ms)

As you can see Groovy `each` method with a closure can be faster than other variants when static
compilation is enabled. But is it always like that? It depends.

== Small collection size

Let's run the same benchmark, but this time let's limit the numbers of elements in the input list from 10 millions to
10 thousands and see what the results are.

.Benchmark results for a list of size 10K
[source,text]
----
Benchmark                                       Mode  Cnt  Score    Error  Units
GroovyBench.eachTest                            avgt  120  0,087 ±  0,001  ms/op
GroovyBench.forEachTest                         avgt  120  0,079 ±  0,001  ms/op
GroovyBench.forLoopTest                         avgt  120  0,157 ±  0,002  ms/op
GroovyBench.iteratorTest                        avgt  120  0,079 ±  0,002  ms/op
GroovyBench.java8ForEachWithAnonymousClassTest  avgt  120  0,085 ±  0,001  ms/op
GroovyBench.java8ForEachWithClosureTest         avgt  120  0,402 ±  0,002  ms/op
----

Things got change as you can see.

* For 10k size collection the best result gave Java for-each and iterator - `0.079` ms average.
* Java 8 `forEach` with anonymous class was only `0.006` ms slower - `0.085` ms average.
* Groovy `each` was only `0.008` ms slower than the best result - `0.087` ms average.
* And again the slowest variant was Java 8 `forEach` with a closure - `0.402` ms average.

Even though Groovy `each` didn't record the best result this time, it is still very close to the fastest variant.

== Benchmarking Java

Before we close this article, let's take a quick look at the Java benchmark results to get a better understanding
how Groovy efficiency differs from Java. Below you can find results of Java benchmark test for two variants - old
Java for-each and iterator:

.Benchmark results for Java and 10M collection size
[source,text]
----
Benchmark                                       Mode  Cnt    Score   Error  Units
JavaBench.javaForEach                           avgt  120    8,839 ± 0,011  ms/op
JavaBench.javaIteratorTest                      avgt  120    8,865 ± 0,011  ms/op
----

Let's compare the results:

* Groovy for-each took in average `96.422` ms while Java did the same job in approximately `8.839` ms.
* Groovy iterator test took in average `103.568` ms while Java did the same job in approximately `8.865` ms.

== Conclusion

Now it is the good time to draw a conclusion.

* When you program in statically compiled Groovy there is no difference if you use `each` with a closure or you
stick to old for-each constructions that don't require creating a closure.
* When you program in a dynamic Groovy and you need more efficient iteration algorithm - extract code to a statically
compiled class, otherwise you will lost a lot of milliseconds in case of a huge collections.
* When you can choose between Groovy and Java and you need blazing fast solution - pick Java.
* And remember that _"premature optimization is root of all evil"_ footnote:[https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Donald_Knuth#Computer_Programming_as_an_Art_.281974.29] - before
you start refactoring your iteration code make sure that switching from one variant to another will give you a real boost. Your application
most probably spends most of the time on I/O (e.g. loading data from the database) and saving a millisecond here or there
might not be worth the effort.
