We have learned how to create https://www.graalvm.org/[GraalVM] native image from standalone Groovy script
+++{% post_link graalvm-groovy-grape-creating-native-image-of-standalone-script in the previous blog post %}+++.
Today we continue the experiments, and this time we are going to create a https://www.docker.com/why-docker[Docker] image to see what are
the benefits and drawbacks of this solution.

== Introduction

In the previous blog post, we have created a standalone Groovy script that uses Jsoup library as a dependency.
This script connects to the given URL and counts how many links the specified website contains.
We saw a significant improvement in execution time - from *1.7 s* (using Groovy command line processor)
to *0.2 s* (using GraalVM native image). However, building the final native image required installing
GraalVM on our local system. Also, we may need to compile OS-specific executable every time we want to
run the program on a different platform or operating system. This is where we start thinking about
containerization, and today we are going to dockerize a Groovy script to play around with it.

NOTE: This blog post originally described using GraalVM `1.0.0-RC11`. You are reading updated
version that was tested to work with GraalVM `19.2.1`.

== Dockerfile

Let's start with defining a Dockerfilefootnote:[https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/].
We use official {graalvm-dockerfile-url}[GraalVM docker base image]. Inside the image, we
install SDKMAN! and Groovy {groovy-version}, then we compile the script and create a native executable with GraalVM.
Finally, we create an entry point which exposes executable and accepts parameters.

.Dockerfile
[source,dockerfile]
----
FROM oracle/graalvm-ce:19.2.1 <1>

ADD . /app/ <2>

ENV GROOVY_VERSION="2.5.8"
ENV GROOVY_HOME=/root/.sdkman/candidates/groovy/$GROOVY_VERSION <3>

RUN yum install -y zip unzip <4>
RUN gu install native-image <5>
RUN curl -s "https://get.sdkman.io" | bash <6>
RUN bash -c "source $HOME/.sdkman/bin/sdkman-init.sh && \ <7>

    groovy -version && \
    cd /app/ && \
    sh ./compile-native-image.sh"

ENTRYPOINT bash -c "cd /app && ./countlinks.sh $0"
----
<1> The official Oracle GraalVM {graalvm-version} base image.
<2> We copy all files from current directory to `/app` directory inside the image/
<3> We set up required `GROOVY_HOME` env variable.
<4> We install `zip` and `unzip` (required by SDKMAN!)
<5> We install `native-image` using GraalVM Updater.
<6> We install SDKMAN!
<7> We init SDKMAN! after successful installation
<8> We set auto answer to `true` so SDKMAN! does not ask as if we want to install Groovy
<9> We install Groovy {groovy-version}

== Building the Docker image

It's time to build the Docker image.

.Building Docker image with `countlinks` tag
[source,bash]
----
docker build -t countlinks .
----

++++
<script id="asciicast-222451" src="https://asciinema.org/a/222451.js" async></script>
++++

After approximately 3-4 minutes our Docker image is created and ready to use.
You can find it with `docker images` command. Keep in mind that the created image is almost 2.2 GB
because our base Docker image is based on Oracle Linux official docker image.

== Running the container

Let's run our program inside the container.

[source,bash]
----
time docker run --rm --read-only countlinks https://e.printstacktrace.blog <1>
Website https://e.printstacktrace.blog contains 96 links.

real	0m0,810s <2>
user	0m0,027s
sys	0m0,021s
----
<1> `--rm` option removes the container when it exists, `--read-only` mounts the file system with the read-only mode (we don't need write permission in this case)


The first thing we notice is that the execution time increased from *0.2 s* to somewhere around *0.8 s*.
It means that our program executed as a Docker container runs 4 times slower. Why?

The thing is that creating and starting a new container comes with a cost. It takes around *600 ms* on my
computer. For instance, if I run `echo` command inside the newly created Alpine container (4 MB image),
it takes almost 600 ms to complete.

[source,bash]
----
time docker run --rm --read-only --entrypoint "echo" alpine

real	0m0,631s
user	0m0,030s
sys	0m0,024s

== Executing command inside a running container

There is an alternative approach, however. Instead of creating and starting a new container each time we
want to run a program, we can start a container, keep it running and attach and execute a command when
needed. Let's give it a try. Firstly, we run a container that executes `tail -f /var/log/yum.log`
command to keep it running. We need to override entry point to do so and add `-d` option to detach
from the container. We also use `--name` parameter to specify the name of this container so that we
can use it instead of container ID. Next, we use `docker exec` to execute another command inside the
running container.

[source,bash]
----
docker run -d --name countlinks --rm --read-only --entrypoint "tail" countlinks -f /var/log/yum.log
b75eef8c3a3aa696d87e284fc59600261baaf126c1fd2efc196f4df5ff9a4ee0 <1>

time docker exec countlinks cd /app && time ./countlinks.sh https://e.printstacktrace.blog

real	0m0,100s <2>
user	0m0,024s
sys	0m0,014s
Website https://e.printstacktrace.blog contains 96 links.

real	0m0,209s <3>
user	0m0,021s
sys	0m0,008s
----
<1> Container ID returned when detaching from the container.
<2> Time consumed by attaching `docker exec` to the running container
<3> Time consumed by running the command inside the container

In this case, we use `time` command twice. The first one counts the time of attaching to the running
container, while the second one counts the time of the inner command execution. We see that it
produces a much better result - attaching to the container takes around 110 ms. So the total execution
time takes approximately *300 ms average*. It is still slower comparing to the result we get when running
native executable outside the container, but in most cases, 110 ms is an acceptable cost.

== Conclusion

So is it worth dockerizing GraalVM native images? It depends. If our goal is to produce an executable that
completes in a blink of an eye, and where every millisecond counts - running the command inside a container
won't be the best choice. However, if this is not our case, we can benefit from dockerizing the native
image. It allows us building the executable without having GraalVM or Groovy installed on the
computer - it only requires Docker on board. It also makes the distribution of the executable
easier - the image once created and pushed to the repository can be reused easily.

And last but not least - dockerizing native executable means that we benefit from ahead-of-time compilation
and much lower memory footprint. However, we always have to be careful when it comes to running any
Java program inside the container - things like available resources (CPU, memory), secure access or
networking may cause some issues. You just have to consider all pros and cons when choosing one
option over another.
