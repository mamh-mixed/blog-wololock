Today I've decided to improve my Github account settings a bit. I thought that it would be nice to add GPG key to it
and sign all commits pushed from my computer. Everything worked great until I tried to commit the first change directly
from my IntelliJ IDEA.

== Introduction

Why even bother with signing commits with GPG key? The most important reason is quite simple - it proves that you
are the author of a given commit. Or to be more precise - the key that was used to sign this commit matches the key
associated with your account. Github honors signing commits with this pretty lovely badge added to the commit history log.

Signing git commits make even more sense if you use tools like https://keybase.io/wololock[Keybase.io] to chat and share files in a secure (encrypted) fashion.

== How to sign Git commits?

First of all, you need to have a GPG key. Github's help pagefootnote:[https://help.github.com/en/articles/managing-commit-signature-verification] explains in details how to generate a key, as well as
how to associate it with your account. I encourage you to read it - it won't take more than 5 minutes of your time.

Next, you need to configure your Git client to use the key. Depending on your preferences, you might want to set
up GPG signing globally, or you can do it locally for a single repository. In my case, I decided to set up signing
commits at the global level with the following two commands:

[source,bash]
----
$ git config --global commit.gpgsign true
$ git config --global user.signingkey YOURKEYHERE
----

If you use Git from the command line, that is all you have to do. You can create the first commit and push it
to Github to see _"Verified"_ badge next to your commit history log entry.

== Getting into troubles with IntelliJ IDEA

I assume you also use your IDE's built-in Git client. I use IntelliJ IDEA daily, and I use its Git client a
lot. When I tried to create the first commit after enabling GPG signing, IDEA's client stopped working,
and it started failing with the following error:

[source,plain]
----
gpg failed to sign the data fatal: failed to write commit object
----

I started googling to see what the problem is. It quickly turned out that this is not the IDEA's problem, but rather
Git and GnuPG issue. It fails to sign the commit if Git command is executed without TTY, so GPG cannot prompt
to ask you for a password. I've quickly found a solution that suggested creating an alias that executes
gpg with `--batch --no-tty` options.  I created a script:

./usr/local/bin/gpg-no-tty
[source,bash]
----
#!/bin/bash
/usr/bin/gpg --batch --no-tty "$@"
----

Then I added the following block to my `.gitconfig` file.

..gitconfig
[source,bash]
----
[gpg]
program = gpg-no-tty
----

The solutions I've found promised that in this case IDEA will use `gpg-agent` that can store the password in the keyring and automatically sign the commit. Well, it didn't work for me. At least not right away.

== Fedora Linux 29 use case

I use Fedora Linux, and it seemed to be a critical factor in this story. I had to went through a few more articles,
and I've finally found the answer. When I applied the solution that uses `--batch --no-tty` for the first time,
it didn't take any effect. However, it turned out that `gpg-agent` works with GPG 2.x. When I run `gpg --version`
I noticed the following:

[source,bash]
----
$ gpg --version

It revealed that `gpg` in my system points to version `1.4.23`. Would it mean that there is no GPG 2.x in Fedora Linux?
Nope, not really. GPG 2.x is available for Fedora Linux, but as a `gpg2` shell command.

When I replaced the initial script with `gpg2` - it worked as expected.

.The final version of /usr/local/bin/gpg-no-tty
[source,bash]
----
#!/bin/bash
/usr/bin/gpg2 --batch --no-tty "$@"
----

I was able to create the first commit from IntelliJ IDEA.
The `gpg-agent` prompted for the password and I was able to store it in the keyring.

== UPDATE: `--batch --no-tty` not needed with GPG2

I just make some experiments and it seems like using intermediate script that adds `--batch --no-tty` switches is no needed
when you use `gpg2` with `gpg-agent`. _(At least in my case)_. My current setup is the following. I have changed the default gpg program to `gpg2` in my
`~/.gitconfig` file:

.Make sure the following two lines are added at the end of your `~/.gitconfig file
[source,bash]
----
[gpg]
program = gpg2
----

Here is my `gpg-agent` version.

[source,bash]
----
$ gpg-agent --version
gpg-agent (GnuPG) 2.2.13
libgcrypt 1.8.4
Copyright (C) 2019 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
License GPLv3+: GNU GPL version 3 or later <https://gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html>

----

Make sure that `gpg-agent` daemon is running. You can start it with the following command:

[source,bash]
----
$ gpg-agent --daemon
----

When you create a first signed commit via command line or from IntelliJ IDEA (I've checked both cases after removing remembered password
from the keyring), `gpg-agent` will prompt and ask you for a password that can be stored in the keyring.

[NOTE]
====
If you removed remembered GPG key password from the keyring and you want to test if `gpg-agent` prompts again for the password correctly,
remember to shut down the daemon and restart it.

[source,bash]
----
$ gpgconf --kill gpg-agent

$ gpg-agent --daemon
----
