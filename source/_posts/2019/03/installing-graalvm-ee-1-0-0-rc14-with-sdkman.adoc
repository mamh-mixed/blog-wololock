I love https://sdkman.io/[*_SDKMAN!_*]. It made using multiple different Java distributions in a single operating system much more
comfortable. You can install Java across different versions (from 6 to 13.EA) and different vendors (OpenJDK,
Oracle, Zulu, Corretto or GraalVM CE to name a few). Switching between those versions is as simple as executing
a single `sdk use java {version}` command and you are ready to use whatever Java you want. However, not all
Java versions are available by default, but luckily, _SDKMAN!_ has a simple solution to this problem.

== Installing GraalVM EE 1.0.0-RC14

I run some experiments with https://www.graalvm.org/[GraalVM] and the only version I can install directly with
_SDKMAN!_ is GraalVM Community Edition. However, there is also GraalVM Enterprise Edition which provides some
additional features, like improved performance. The main reason GraalVM EE is not available in _SDKMAN!_ is
that it is distributed over OTN (Oracle Technology Network) only, so you need to accept OTN license agreementfootnote:[https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/licenses/early-adopter-license-2299792.html]
and log in to start the file download. OK, so I downloaded *graalvm-ee-1.0.0-rc14-linux-amd64.tar.gz* file
successfully. What's next?

Let's start with the extracting files from the downloaded archive.

[source,bash]
----
$ tar -xvf graalvm-ee-1.0.0-rc14-linux-amd64.tar.gz
----

After extracting all files, we can install local Java distribution with the following command.

[source,bash]
----
$ sdk install java graal-ee-rc14 /path/to/graalvm-ee-1.0.0-rc14
----

In the above example, *graal-ee-rc14* is a version used by _SDKMAN!_ we want to associate with the Java
installation located in */path/to/graalvm-ee-1.0.0-rc14*.

NOTE: _SDKMAN!_ limits version to 15 characters.

When you execute `sdk list java` command, you will see local GraalVM EE added to SDKMAN's Java distributions list.

[source,bash]
----
$ sdk list java

The last thing to do to use GraalVM EE is to switch to a proper Java version, and you are ready to go.

[source,bash]
----
$ sdk use java graal-ee-rc14

Using java version graal-ee-rc14 in this shell.

$ java -version

java version "1.8.0_202"
Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_202-b08)
Java HotSpot(TM) GraalVM EE 1.0.0-rc14 (build 25.202-b08-jvmci-0.56, mixed mode)
----


NOTE: If you don't know where to keep extracted GraalVM EE sources, there is one workaround that allows keeping
all Java distributions together. Instead of extracting _graalvm-ee-1.0.0-rc14-linux-amd64.tar.gz_ at some random
location, extract it directly to `~/.sdkman/candidates/java/graal-ee-rc14` directory. After doing so, you
don't have to execute `sdk install java ...` command, because your GraalVM EE is already
available on `sdk list java` distributions list.

== Conclusion

I hope you have learned something useful from this short blog post. _SDKMAN!_ is a powerful tool that makes developer's
life easier. I use it to manage in a convenient way all my Java, Groovy, or Gradle installations. If you haven't used
it so far, I strongly recommend giving _SDKMAN!_ a chance.
