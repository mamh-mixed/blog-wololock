It's a much brighter lens that offers a significant image quality improvement. I use it while I record all of my YouTube videos. The focal length (the equivalent of 50mm in a full-frame camera) is quite challenging, but it produces a much better image than the kit lens. If you own G7/G85 and you think about the first upgrade - consider getting this affordable lens."
