I hate ads and popups showing up a few seconds after visiting a website.
That is why I decided to keep my blog free from those annoying elements.
I care about excellent user experience, and my goal is to offer you one that can be compared to reading an ebook.
No distracting banners, no ads, no stupid popups.
Just clean and well-formatted content.

Does it mean that I don't want to monetize my blog by any form?
Not necessarily.
I just believe that there are better forms to do that.
In the last 6 months (from October 1st, 2019 to March 27th, 2020), more than *110,000 unique users* visited my blog.
I don't expect support from every reader, this is unrealistic.
But I believe there is a chance that 0.1% of my readers (or my YouTube subscribers) could support my work and effort in one way or another.
Would you like to give it a try?

I want to use it as a way to invest more in the e.printstacktrace.blog development and growth.

If you find my work valuable, and you want to [.mark]*support it*, consider becoming a *sponsor* / *patron* / *supporter* of the e.printstacktrace.blog.
I strongly believe that *high-quality* and *ad-free* content can attract people that appreciate such an approach.
If you can afford a small monthly (or even one-time) donation, consider supporting me through one of the following platforms:

[.nobullets]
* icon:arrow-circle-right[role="color-green"] *{github-sponsor-profile}["GitHub Sponsors", role="ga-track"]* platform,
* icon:arrow-circle-right[role="color-green"] *{opencollective-url}["Open Collective", role="ga-track"]* platform.

=== [.circle-orange]#2# Check out books and other things I do recommend (affiliate links)

I enjoy buying and reading {books}["books", role="ga-track"].
If you do the same, I have created {kitco}["a few curated collections", role="ga-track"] of books (and other things) I can recommend.
Maybe you will find something interesting for yourself.
Those lists contain affiliate links - *if you click on any of them and subsequently make a purchase, I&nbsp;will earn a small commission*.
Using an affiliate link doesn't affect the final price - there is no additional cost to you.

NOTE: Please do not spend any money on these products *unless you feel they are useful and valuable to you*.

=== [.circle-orange]#3# Hire me as a mentor / teacher / problem solver

I icon:heart[role="color-red"] solving problems and {stackoverflow-url}["helping", role="ga-track"] other people.
If you feel stuck with your learning process, or you face problems that are too difficult for you to solve, feel free to contact me ({email-me}["email", role="ga-track"] or {codementor}["CodeMentor.io", role="ga-track"]) and I will do my best to help you.
I can offer you either a quick solution-oriented session or a long-term mentoring relationship - whatever works for you best.

Also, if you are a *team leader* or an *engineering manager*, I can offer you (and your team) help through online training, workshop, or consulting.

My top competences are:

https://e.printstacktrace.blog/t/devops[`devops`]


=== [.circle-orange]#4# Subscribe to my YouTube channel

Did you know that I also create icon:youtube[role="color-red"] YouTube videos? {youtube}[Subscribing to my channel, role="ga-track"], *commenting* videos and hitting that *like button* is also a great way to support my work.

=== [.circle-orange]#5# Share your favorite blog post

Which blog post was the most valuable to you?
Was it _{groovy-regexp-url}_?
Or maybe _{jenkins-pipeline-envvars-url}_?
Or maybe some other one?

Do you use icon:twitter[role="color-twitter"] Twitter?
{twitter}[I do].
I will be very *grateful* if you could *share one of your favorite blog posts* with your followers.
That way, you can help me reach out with my content to new people.

=== [.circle-orange]#6# Send me an e-mail icon:envelope-o[]

And last but not least, you can always {email-me}["email me", role="ga-track"] and just say [.mark]_"Thanks!"_ if you found any of my blog posts useful.
I will be happy to write back to you! icon:smile-o[]

== What do I [.mark]#need# the extra money for?

The maintenance cost of my blog is quite low.
I use GitHub Pages to host the static website, I use Cloudflare free plan to manage DNS, SSL, and some necessary network protection.
However, there are some additional costs and investments I would like to cover with your help, that includes:

[.nobullets]
* icon:arrow-circle-right[role="color-green"] Annual domain renewal. (~$50/yr)
* icon:arrow-circle-right[role="color-green"] Annual Disqus Plus _(a free plan adds some random ads around comments section.)_ (~$108/yr)
* icon:arrow-circle-right[role="color-green"] Annual Grammarly.com subscription. (~$140/yr)
* icon:arrow-circle-right[role="color-green"] Investing in video/audio gear to produce better quality content.
* icon:arrow-circle-right[role="color-green"] Investing in products and services that help me to deliver high-quality blog posts.

== Thank you!

Thank you for reading up to this point.
I hope you are a returning happy reader of my blog.
If you can afford to support my work, I will be *thankful* for any kind of it.
But don't feel forced to it.
I will continue doing my work on the blog and on my YouTube channel.
I enjoy it, and I see that my effort is not pointless - I keep getting thankful messages from you, and that makes me really proud and happy.
*Keep learning, keep coding, and have fun!*

[%hardbreaks]
Yours sincerely,
Szymon
